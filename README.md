Files for Nik Bear Brown's Medium articles.  You can use these however you like but I'd appreciate a link back. I'm a Northeastern Engineering Associate Teaching Professor & Affiliate Professor at EAI  - Aspiring Entrepreneur, Digital Artist, TikTok Dancer, YouTuber, and Fitness Model.  I write about all of these subjects on Medium.

 I draw with words, ChatGPT, and DALLE 2. See the entire Nik Bear Brown DALLE 2 collection https://labs.openai.com/sc/m1eQMAi6DFWI4VrKOqtkJkmj
